-- Its name and detail, written to one pattern:
--   name: the kind and the brand — Thai kind first ("ประตู AZLE"), English brand first ("AZLE door"); no brand → the
--     kind alone. No shop codes.
--   detail: the rest, in the same order in both: model, material, size, pack, colour, finish, then what it comes
--     with or can do — Thai separated by spaces, English by commas. A product with a size shows it. Sizes w × h × d,
--     with spaced ×; inches as " (Thai นิ้ว); a pack as "pack of 3" (Thai แพ็ก 3 …); a length in Thai as ยาว ….
--     What it is for goes in a line's note, not here. The list shows "name detail" / "name, detail". Either shows
--     the size with {w} {h} {d} in mm, {w_cm} … in cm or {w_m} … in m — never a dimension typed twice — and an
--     electrical product its rating with {ip}.
-- Sizes (w wide, h high, d deep; a tile is w × h) are in mm. A single figure that isn't a dimension — a weight, a
-- volume, a stock length, an inch trade size — stays in the detail ("50 kg", "4 m", "½\"").
